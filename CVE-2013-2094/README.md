# CVE-2013-2094

The `perf_swevent_init` function in kernel/events/core.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.9 uses an incorrect integer data type, which allows local users to gain priviledge via a crafted `perf_event_open` system call.

This [blog post](http://timetobleed.com/a-closer-look-at-a-recent-privilege-escalation-bug-in-linux-cve-2013-2094/) has done a good analysis of this vulnerability.

Put simply, the poc modifies the invoking address of IDT 4 to the userland address. The code in the userland address changes the credential of the target process to gain priviledge. The hard part is to find out the target address which is changed by `atomic_inc` in `perf_swevent_init`.
