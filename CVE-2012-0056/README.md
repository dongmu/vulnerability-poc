# CVE-2012-0056

This vulnerability is caused by the unauthorized access to `/proc/pid/mem`.

The exploit leverages the SUID program. Then two problems should be solved: `self_exec_id` and the target address. `self_exec_id` is solved by fork an initial child process and write back to the parent process's `/proc/pid/mem`. The target address is the address of (exit@plt) of `su` with some calculations. Namely, the exploit write the error message to stderr, which has been a duplicate of fd -- `/proc/pid/mem`. The letters of the head of the error message should be calculated andthen be put in front of the target address. Thus the shellcode is put into the exact place of "(exit@plt)".
