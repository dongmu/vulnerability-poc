# CVE-2012-0056

This vulnerability is caused by the unauthorized access to `/proc/pid/mem`.

The exploit leverages the SUID program. Then two problems should be solved: `self_exec_id` and the target address. `self_exec_id` is solved by fork an initial child process and write back to the parent process's `/proc/pid/mem`. The target address is the address of (exit@plt) of `su` with some calculations. Find more info in this [blog post](http://blog.zx2c4.com/749) which details this vulnerability.
